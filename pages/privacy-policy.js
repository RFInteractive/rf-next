                    Any marketing emails sent out by Rank Fuse will give you the
                    option to “opt-out” of receiving any future marketing
                    emails. If you opt out, we may still send non-marketing
                    emails, including emails about your accounts and our
                    business dealings with you.
                    <h3>Part V. Data Storage Transfer, and Security</h3>
                    We use industry-standard methods for securing electronic
                    databases of personal information. However, no company,
                    including Rank Fuse, can fully eliminate security risks
                    associated with personal information. Protect yourself by
                    using a strong password that you aren’t using on other
                    accounts. You should also protect your usernames and
                    passwords to help prevent others from accessing your
                    accounts. Personal information that we collect may be
                    retained for as long as needed to fulfill legitimate
                    business purposes or for a period of time specifically
                    required or allowed by applicable regulations or laws.
                    <h3>Part VI. Modifications</h3>
                    Rank Fuse has the right to amend this Privacy Policy at any
                    time by posting the amended version on the Rank Fuse website
                    or by providing such notice about or obtaining consent to
                    changes as may be required by applicable law.
